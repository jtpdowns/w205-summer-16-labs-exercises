Hi Manos,

Sorry for the delay with this, but I was a little disheartened, and I wasn't sure exactly what the deadline was after the extension. I was unable to even install streamparse properly on my last few attempts, and I worry that something may have changed with the software. It's possible that I messed up something with the systems administration, but I was unable to overcome it.

I attempted to write the database interaction scripts based on examples that I saw online, and I hope that they would work in a real application, but I was unable to test them. Also, since I didn't get data, I couldn't generate the Plot.png file or the screenshots that were requested.

Sorry to underperform here, but it was tough to do much without Storm working for me. It's interesting technology, but I'll probably avoid streaming analytics for a while. Let me know if I can provide you anything else to help grading this easier.

Thanks,
Joe
