PREFACE
The variability of procedures among hospitals will
be determined by comparing the standard deviations
of the scores grouped by procedure, where the score
comes from the "Timely and Effective Care" file.

RESULTS
Emergency Department                101.56450810284                                         
Heart Attack or Chest Pain          36.44250772948896
Blood Clot Prevention and Treatment 27.70563922846628
Preventive Care                     15.32606737941426
Stroke Care                         10.188649927111449
Heart Failure                       10.057839843078725
Pneumonia                           9.275894472939902
Children's Asthma                   8.847945944880063
Pregnancy and Delivery Care         6.958257962124783
Surgical Care Improvement Project   4.738913076942953

CONCLUSION
It seems that the most variability occurs primarily
in the handling of emergency medical services and
cardiovascular disorders. It is worth noting in
particular that the standard deviation in emergency
department treatment score is nearly a factor of three
larger than the deviation in the next highest value.
