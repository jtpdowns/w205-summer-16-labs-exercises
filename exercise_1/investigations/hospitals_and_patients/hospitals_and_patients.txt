PREFACE
To determine the relationship between hospital
quality metrics and patient satisfaction, the
scores for mean and standard deviation according
to the "Timely and Effective Care" file will be
compared to the number of stars from patient
surveys for the hospital.

RESULTS
-0.22229487706036485

CONCLUSION
The number above represents the Pearson
correlation between the average patient rating
for a hospital and the average score by the
quality metric for that same hospital. This value
came out to be negative, though relatively small.
This certainly suggests that there is no positive
relationship, which is counterintuitive. It is possible
that hospitals unable to treat patients efficiently
maintain above average bedside manner, or it could
be that hospitals operating efficiently do so with
and emphasis on throughput and moving patients
out quickly and even brusquely. More likely, this
may be an instance of Simpson's paradox, such that
stratifying by another hidden variable could cause
strong positive correlation.
