Please run all files from this directory.
Do not cd into child directories to run.
For example, use
`. loading_and_modeling/load_data_lake.sh`

This also assumes the existence of
/user/w205 directory already defined
in HDFS. Furthermore, the user should
be w205 and Hadoop, PostgreSQL, and
the Hive Metastore should be running.

All commands were tested using spark-sql.
